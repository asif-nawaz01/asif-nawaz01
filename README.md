## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Asif Nawaz**, a Computer Science undergraduate from **UCET Hazaribagh**, driven by curiosity and a goal to become a **skilled full-stack developer**.

Coming from Jharkhand, I’ve learned that passion, consistency, and resilience can outshine any resource limitation. Every day, I’m focused on learning something new, writing better code, and building things that matter.

### 🔎 My Learning Mindset
- ✨ **Simplicity wins** — Clean, clear code over clever tricks  
- 🛠 **Learn by doing** — Projects teach better than theory  
- ⚙️ **Hackathon hustle** — Speed, MVP focus, & collaboration  
- 🧱 **Routine > Motivation** — Show up. Build. Repeat.

## 📚 My Learning Journey

> I don’t just follow tutorials — I **experiment, debug, and create**.

My learning is a cycle of:  
**"Learn → Apply → Reflect → Iterate"**

| Level        | What I'm Doing                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧱 Foundation | Solid in Core Java, OOP principles, DSA (via GFG), and logic building          |
| ⚙️ Intermediate | Confident with JavaScript, DOM manipulation, ES6+, and async patterns         |
| 🔧 Practical   | Developed secure backend systems using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT      |
| 🚀 Advancing   | Exploring React.js deeply; moving toward Next.js and scalable architecture     |

Thanks for visiting my profile!  
I believe in **building with purpose**, **learning by doing**, and **growing through collaboration**.  
Let’s connect, collaborate, and bring something impactful to life. 🚀
```

### How to Use It

1. Copy and paste the content above into a `README.md` file in your GitHub profile repo (`asif-nawaz01/asif-nawaz01`).
2. Update any personal project details as you launch new ones.
3. Add or edit the LinkedIn link if needed (I guessed the pattern — double-check it).

Would you like me to generate a Ghibli-style avatar or GitHub banner image to match the vibe?
